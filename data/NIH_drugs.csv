Clarithromycin,,MALT Lymphoma,SEE_REMARKS,"Treatment of the H. pylori infection leads to regression of the lymphoma in about 8 out of every 10 people with gastric MALT lymphoma who showed evidence of an H. pylori infection. The treatment is most successful when the tumor has not extended very far through the stomach wall and has not spread to the lymph nodes.
An initial course of antibiotic treatment for H. pylori eradication is clarithromycin together with either amoxicillin or metronidazole. These antibiotics are usually given with a drug that cuts down the amount of acid the stomach produces (a proton pump inhibitor or 'PPI' drug such as omeprazole). This combination of three drugs is often called ‘triple therapy’ and is taken for 10–14 days.

How to code: IF given to treat carcinoid syndrome, do not code. If give or stated to be prescribed to treat the tumor, then code as hormone

This drug is indicated for the treatment of acromegaly when the circulating levels of growth hormone remain abnormal after surgery and/or radiotherapy, but also used for the treatment of thyrotrophic adenomas when the circulating level of thyroid stimulating hormone remains inappropriately high after surgery and/or radiotherapy.

The treatment is most successful when the tumor has not extended very far through the stomach wall and has not spread to the lymph nodes

An initial course of antibiotic treatment for H. pylori eradication is clarithromycin together with either amoxicillin or metronidazole. These antibiotics are usually given with a drug that cuts down the amount of acid the stomach produces (a proton pump inhibitor or 'PPI' drug such as omeprazole). This combination of three drugs is often called ‘triple therapy’ and is taken for 10–14 days.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) – used to prevent pregnancy – may also be an effective treatment for some patients with early-stage uterine cancer who want to preserve their fertility. In a small, early study (2010), carefully selected patients with cancer that had not spread beyond the inner lining of the uterus were treated with IUDs that released the hormone progesterone. The treatment was found to be as effective as oral hormone therapy, which is the most widely used nonsurgical, fertility-sparing treatment for the cancer. It is important to note that this treatment has not received finally FDA approval but may still be prescribed off-label. If the physician states it is prescribed to shrink the cancer then code as Other treatment. If given to control bleeding consider it palliative treatment.

The intended use is for the focal destruction of malignant tumors of the breast up to 15 mm; for general surgery procedures including incision, excision, and ablation of soft tissues; and coagulative necrosis and interstitial laser coagulation of soft tissues.

The device, the NovoTTF-100L System (Novocure), is the first treatment for MPM approved by the FDA in 15 years, since pemetrexed was approved in 2004. TTF therapy uses electric fields to disrupt solid tumor cancer cell division.

The NovoTTF-100A system treats recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The NovoTTF-100A system is a first-of-its-kind treatment that fights cancerous brain tumors using electrical energy fields. It is a portable battery or power-supply operated device which produces chagning electrical fields, called tumor treatment fields (TTFields) within the human body. TTFields are applied to the head of the patient by electrically-insulated surface electrodes. TTFields stop the growth of tumor cells resulting in cell death of the rapidly dividing cancer cells.  The frequency of the TTFields used for a particular treatment is specific to the size of the cell type being treated. This system is intended as a treatment for adult patients (22 years of age or older) with confirmed glioblastoma multiforme, following confirmed recurrence in an upper region of the brain (supratentorial) after receiving chemotherapy. The device is intended to be used as a stand-alone treatment, and is intended as an alternative to standard medical therapy for recurrent GBM after surgical and radiation options have been exhausted.",NovaTTF;OPTUNE,Brain (Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme) GBM,,,Other therapy,

April 6, 2018: The FDA approved rucaparib (Rubraca), a PARP inhibitor, for the maintenance treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.

December 19, 2016 The FDA granted accelerated approval to Rubraca (rucaparib) to treat women with a certain type of ovarian cancer. Rubraca is approved for women with advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and whose tumors have a specific gene mutation (deleterious BRCA) as identified by an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test. BRCA genes are involved with repairing damaged DNA and normally work to prevent tumor development. However, mutations of these genes may lead to certain cancers, including ovarian cancers. Rubraca is a poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor that blocks an enzyme involved in repairing damaged DNA. By blocking this enzyme, DNA inside the cancerous cells with damaged BRCA genes may be less likely to be repaired, leading to cell death and possibly a slow-down or stoppage of tumor growth.",Rucaparib,Ovary,,,Chemotherapy,PARP (poly-ADP-ribose polymerase)
